### üéö MIDI Modify

Modify incoming MIDI messages in two main ways:

  Redirect all incoming MIDI messages to one or two selected MIDI channels.
  This allows you to play two synths at the same time.
  Also allows very quick channel changes between scenes.

- **MIDI Split**  
  Split the keyboard into two zones:  
  - Notes below a split point go to one MIDI channel.  
  - Notes above go to another.  
  Ideal for controlling two synths with one keyboard.

> The split point and both output channels are fully configurable.

> The switch between MIDI Change and MIDI Split is made by pressing the select button when selecting a MIDI Change or MIDI Split item

> The OUTs are fully configurable between OUT 1, OUT 2, OUT 1 & 2 & Split.

  *(Range: -50 to +50)*

  All incoming notes are set to a fixed velocity.  
  Useful for consistent volume or triggering.
